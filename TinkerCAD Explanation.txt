The button is wired into the arduino digital pin 4. When digital pin 4 recieves power it then turns on digital
pin 3 which turns on the 2 light wired into it. This allows the light to stay on while the button is being 
pushed which gives a visual feeback on when it's pressed. The button would act as an input for the duck to do 
another action like attacking, hiding, etc...

The 2 potentiometers simulate a joystick and you can see in the serial monitor it is pushing values of the
potentiometers which would translate to the x and y position of the duck on screen.
